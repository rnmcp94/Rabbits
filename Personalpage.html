  <h1>Rabbits Are Amazing Pets</h1>
  <p >Rabbits are amazing, affectionate, and social pets. Although very overlooked, rabbits are amazing pets. I believe more people should see rabbits as great options for any family looking for a new pet. Although caring for a rabbit can take a little time, effort, and research, rabbits are very social and intelligent animals.

<h3>Should You Be A Rabbit Parent?</h3>
<p>Here are a few reasons why rabbits are good pets:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Rabbits are quiet animals that use non-verbal communication and don't fill the house with noise like dogs that bark ceaselessly or cats that meow, or even birds.</li>
  <li>Rabbits have the life expectency of 8-12 years.</li>
  <li>There are at least 305 breeds of domestic rabbits known worldwide, meaning there's a different breed for many different personalities.</li>
  <li>When comfortable, rabbits have big personalities like many other traditional pets.</li>
  <li>For a busy family that may not have time to walk a dog daily, a rabbit is exactly what you are looking for.</li>
  <li>Rabbits are crepuscular, meaning that they are not diurnal or nocturnal animals; they are animals that are very active early in the morning and at dusk.</li>
  <li>Rabbits are herbivorous animals, so their diet consists mostly of vegetables, fruit, cereals, and seeds.</li>
  <li>Rabbits love to be with other rabbits, but if you raise them with humans from when they are young and they receive love and affection, then they connect deeply with humans.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Rabbit Care</h3>
</div>
<p>Rabbits are animals that have specific needs.</p>
  <ul>
    <li> Grooming: Another important aspect of rabbit care is grooming, which includes nail-clipping. Because of their constant shedding, rabbits need to be brushed at least weekly to remove loose hair.</li>
    <li>Handling: Because bunnies are prey animals, it can be scary for them to be picked up and handled.</li>
    <li>Cage or hutch: What sort of housing should pet rabbits have? Bunnies should be kept in a safe, conÔ¨Åned, indoor rabbit cage rather than a rabbit hutch located outdoors. </li>
    <li> Litter box training: Rabbits can be trained to use a litter box, but the process is slightly different than that for cats.</li>
    <li>Food: Rabbits have a fairly delicate digestive system. To obtain necessary nutrients, they must be fed a varied diet with hay being the most important part. </li>
  </ul>
